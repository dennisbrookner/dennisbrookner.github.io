## About Me

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Prof. Doeke Hekstra's lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu) in the Harvard Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology. My research involves using X-ray crystallography to explore how protein structure and dynamics contribute to function. After graduate school, I plan to continue working in biochemistry, biophysics, or structural biology, in either academia or industry.

### Computational interests  
  
While my primary training is as an experimental biologist, I also have extensive interest and experience with programming and other computational endeavors. Much of this is tied to my research interests - crystallographic data processing often requires python, bash or both. Additionally, the Hekstra Lab is involved in some [software development](https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab) (crystallographic and otherwise), and I have enjoyed contributing to that pipeline. 
  
Outside of the lab, I have developed a fascination with web design. I have become proficient in HTML and CSS, including building this website. I'm in the process of rewriting the CSS for this website from the ground up, to make sure I really understand every line in my git repo. I am also excited to learn more about how web developers can optimize digital accessibility.
  
Finally, I am a co-founder of [Puntalytics](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts), a premier open-source hub for NFL punting analytics. Our work has been featured in ESPN, the New York Times, the Athletic, the Ringer, and SB Nation. I have also produced an R package, [`puntr`](https://puntalytics.github.io/puntr/), to make it easy for anyone to get started with their own punting analytics. More verbose examples of our work, including interviews with several NFL punters, can be found on the [Puntalytics website](https://puntalytics.github.io/).
  
### Other interests

I am an avid crossword puzzler and an amateur linguistics enthusiast. I am an experienced bassoonist, saxophonist, and singer, as well as a beginner guitarist, pianist, and ukuleleist. Currently, I sing with [VoiceLab a cappella](http://voicelab.us/).

## About Me

I earned my Ph.D. from the Harvard Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology in May 2025. My research in [Prof. Doeke Hekstra's lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu) involves using X-ray crystallography and other biochemical and biophysical methods to explore how protein structure and dynamics contribute to function. 

I'm an experienced experimentalist and python developer/programmer, and I'm seeking a role in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries at the intersection of those two skills. I'm excited to continue developing my passion for biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in my next steps and beyond.

### Research interests  

My research experience has spanned structural biology, biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, and cell biology. I find that biology is the most exciting when atomic-level phenomena can be tied to functional outcomes for an organism. I love learning about cellular pathways and mechanisms, and I especially love when those pathways and mechanisms can be understood all the way down to the molecular level.

I am very interested in protein design, and especially in understanding the challenge of designing proteins with native-like conformational dynamics.

I also have extensive interest in and experience with programming and other computational endeavors. Much of this is tied to my research interests - crystallographic data processing often requires python, bash or both. I am a founding "1/astronaut" for [Reciprocal Space Station](https://rs-station.github.io/), a group developing open-source crystallographic software.
   
### Other interests

Outside of the lab, I have developed a fascination with web design. I am proficient in HTML and CSS, including building this website. I am also excited to learn more about how web developers can optimize digital accessibility.

I am a co-founder of [Puntalytics](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts), a premier open-source hub for NFL punting analytics. Our work has been featured in ESPN, the New York Times, the Athletic, the Ringer, and SB Nation. I have also produced an R package, [`puntr`](https://puntalytics.github.io/puntr/), to make it easy for anyone to get started with their own punting analytics. More verbose examples of our work, including interviews with several NFL punters, can be found on the [Puntalytics website](https://puntalytics.github.io/). 

I am an avid crossword puzzler and an amateur linguistics enthusiast. I am an experienced bassoonist, saxophonist, and singer, as well as a beginner guitarist, pianist, and ukuleleist. Currently, I sing with [VoiceLab a cappella](http://voicelab.us/).

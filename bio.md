## Bio

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in [Prof. Doeke Hekstra's lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu) in the Harvard Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology. I'm interested in using X-ray crystallography to explore how protein structure and dynamics contribute to function. In my spare time, I can be found doing crossword puzzles or contributing to [Puntalytics](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts).
